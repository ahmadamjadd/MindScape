# MindScape ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

**MindScape** is a digital sanctuary designed to support student mental health and well-being through mood tracking, shared experiences, and community care.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Currently, Iâ€™m developing a **mental health chatbot** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It combines the power of:

- **FAISS** for fast vector-based document search
- **LangChain** for prompt chaining and memory management
- **Ollamaâ€™s Qwen-3** large language model for generating empathetic, context-aware responses
- **Flask + HTML/CSS** for a clean and responsive frontend
- **PostgreSQL** as a robust relational database

The chatbot automates context-aware, high-quality answers based on a large mental health dataset while providing a user-friendly interface.
